# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
  - Simple UI, tell user how many guesses they have, has an input box to type guess, has two buttons to submit guess and start a new game, has a toggle to show hint.
- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start  
  (for example: "the secret number kept changing" or "the hints were backwards").
  - Hints were backwards (I guessed a number and it said 'GO LOWER' when I actually needed to 'GO HIGHER')
  - New game button is not creating a new game to start over (Expected it to clear the input and reset the game but it does not do anything)
  - Normal level has range 1-100 while Hard level has range 1-50 (does not really make sense as it would be expected for hard mode to be 1-100 and normal to be 1-50)
  - Easy mode range is 1-20 but the secret number was 44 (does not make sense again as the number should stay within the range of 1-20)
  - Game ended after certain number of attempts but still says I have one attempt remaining (not counting first attempt as an attempt)
    - Reveals secret number even if one attempt is still left + submitting that last attempt (to make it 0) reveals a 'Game Over' message

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?
- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was correct (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).
- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was incorrect or misleading (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?
- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.
- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- In your own words, explain why the secret number kept changing in the original app.
- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?
- What change did you make that finally gave the game a stable secret number?

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
